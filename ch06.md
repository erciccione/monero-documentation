## Seed and keys

![seed-keys](media/black_seed-keys.png)

The `Seeds & Keys` tab displays your wallets mnemonic seed as well as your secret view key, public view key, secret spend key, and public spend key.

**(1) Mnemonic seed: DO NOT share your mnemonic seed with anyone. Store a copy securely.** The mnemonic seed is a 25 word phrase that contains all the information needed to view and spend funds. *Learn more about [mnemonic seeds](https://getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/mnemonicseed.html).*    
**(2) Secret view key:** Secret view keys allows the holder to view your wallets incoming transactions, but not outgoing. It is sometimes useful for auditing purposes to give your secret view key to a third party.    
**(3) Public view key:** The public view key is used for stealth address creation. *Learn more about [view keys](https://getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/viewkey.html).*    
**(4) Secret spend key: DO NOT share your secret spend key with anyone. The secret spend key is used to sign transactions and should be regarded with the same security as your mnemonic seed.**    
**(5) Public spend key:** The public spend key is used by the network to verify the signature of the key image you generate when you make a transaction. This is what prevents double-spends as the network enforces the rule that a key image can be spent only once. *Learn more about [spend keys](https://getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/spendkey.html).*    
**(6) Export Spendable Wallet: DO NOT share your spendable wallet QR code with anyone. This can be used like a mnemonic seed for recovering your wallet.** This creates a qrcode that contains all of your keys.    
**(7) Export View Only Wallet:** This creates a QR code that contains only the keys for viewing the transactions that this wallet sends or receives, but cannot create transactions.
