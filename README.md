This repository contains the guide for the [Monero GUI Wallet](https://github.com/monero-project/monero-gui/releases).
This document is meant to be updated continuously and a new release will be available whenever Monero publishes a new version of the GUI. As said, the *.md* file will be constantly updated, but every release will be also available in **PDF** format. You can find the latest version on the [release page](https://github.com/erciccione/monero-GUI-guide/releases) of this repository.

### Contribute
Monero developement is constant and fast; that's why keeping this guide updated will not be easy. But with the help of the community we can provide an updated document useful for both noobs and Monero veterans.
