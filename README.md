## Guide for the Monero GUI wallet

This repository contains the guide for the [Monero GUI Wallet](https://github.com/monero-project/monero-gui/releases).
This document is meant to be updated continuously and **a new major release will be available whenever Monero publishes a new version of the GUI**.
&nbsp;

The guide is composed by several different markdown files (see the chapter 'structure'). For simplicity, we have an easy-to-consult version:

These single chapters can be built in a single file in 3 different formats: **HTML**, **PDF** and **EPUB**.  
To do so we use pandoc. If you wish to **build the guide by yourself**, you can do it following these steps (on Linux):

1. Download Pandoc, make and all necessary dependencies:
```
sudo apt install pandoc make
sudo apt install texlive texlive-xetex texlive-latex-extra
```

2. From the source of the repository run:
```
make [format][-language]
```
For example, if you wish to build only the Spanish version in PDF format, you should run `make pdf-es`.  
If you want all languages in a single format: `make epub`- This will give you the epub version in all languages.  
If you want to build all formats for all available languages: `make all` - This will build the guide in PDF, HTML and EPUB in all available languages.

### Contribute!
Improvements are always welcome. Feel free to propose a change using the issue tracker or opening a pull request.  
If you wish to contribute, please **do not** edit the file *monero-GUI-guide.md*. That's just temporary and it gets built manually. Work ONLY on the *.md* files inside the 'en' folder. Every pull request with changes to *monero-GUI-guide.md* will be rejected.

## Translations
Before adding a translation, please keep in mind the general guidelines for Monero translators, which are:

- **Avoid** the use of **gender specific** terminology.
- If available, use the **glossary** for your language. This will help to keep translations consistent across different works. You can find all glossaries [here](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-translations/tree/master/terminology-guides).
- Read the guide '[Translation tips for Monero translators](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-translations/blob/master/translation-tips.md)'. **It contains all the information you need** to submit a perfect translation.
- If a string contains numbers, just keep them as they are.

### Steps
Adding a translation is very easy:

1. Copy the *en* folder with all its content (including the 'makefile') and rename the new folder with the codename of your language (for example */it* for Italian).
2. Translate all the text you find, except for code and html.
3. Edit the string `LANGUAGES =` in the main makefile, after 'en' (or the previous added language) add the name of the folder which contains your translations.
4. Push the changes to your local branch and open a pull request.

**Do not edit** the files contained in the /translations folder. They are manually built. All changes MUST be done on the appropriate source folder (/en for English, /es for Spanish, etc..).

### Support
If you need **help/support**, open an issue on this repository or contact ErCiccione. You can do so:
  
+ On the **live support chat of the localization workgroup**: `#monero-translations` (on IRC/Freenode, MatterMost, riot/matrix)
+ By **email**: translate[at]getmonero[dot]org
+ On **reddit**: just PM /u/erciccione

## Donations
The creation and maintainance of this guide require a lot of hours of work. I think it's a very useful document and I'm happy to work on it voluntarily. The only problem is that the creation/maintainance of the guide **requires** a high consumption of beer. If you would like to help me refill my fridge and show the middle finger to my liver, consider donating to this Monero address:
