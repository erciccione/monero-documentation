The `Transactions` tab let you walk through the transactions sent and received on the currently selected account of your Monero wallet.

(1) **Search:** Quickly filter out transactions from the list searching by transaction ID, destination address, description, amount or blockheight (number of the block in which the transaction was mined).  
(2) **Sort & Filter:** Here you can filter out transactions between specific dates, or sort them by blockheight, date or amount.  
(3) **Transaction list:** This area displays the sent and received transactions of the currently selected account. Each transaction is displayed with the following information: `Amount`, `Blockheight`, `Date`, `Fee` (for outgoing transactions), `Confirmations`, `Description` (optional), `Transaction ID`, `Transaction key`, and `Destination address`. The transaction ID, the transaction key and the destination address can be used to prove that a payment was done in case of a dispute. The transaction keys and the descriptions (notes) are stored in the cache of your local wallet, therefore they cannot be recovered from the blockchain.
