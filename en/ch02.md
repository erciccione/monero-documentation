# Main Menu
![welcome](../media/wizard_2-options.png)

On this page you can create a new wallet, open an existing wallet, change wallet mode or change choose how to connect to the wallet and to the network:

(1) **Create a new wallet:** Start the procedure to create a new wallet file. Choose this option if this is your first time using Monero.  
(2) **Create new wallet from hardware:** Create a new wallet file from a hardware wallet device (e.g., Ledger or Trezor).  
(3) **Open a wallet from file:** Choose this option to select a pre-existing wallet file from your computer (with the extension `.keys`).  
(4) **Restore wallet from keys or mnemonic seed:** Click here if you want to recover a pre-existing wallet using the mnemonic seed or the private keys, creating a new wallet file.  
(5) **Change wallet mode:**  Click here to switch between simple, simple (bootstrap), and advanced modes.  

Advanced options (requires wallet in advanced mode):

(6) **Mainnet:** Select this from the dropdown list to use the main Monero network  
(7) **Testnet:** Select this option if you would like to use a development network instead of the main network. Testnet is designed to let developers test new features that are not available on Mainnet or Stagenet.  
(8) **Stagenet:** Select this option if you would like to use a network for staging instead of the main network. Stagenet mimics the features of Mainnet and is designed to let end users test Monero without the risk of losing funds.  
(9) **Number of KDF rounds:** Adjust the number of Key Derivation Function rounds in order to enhance the overall security of the generated keys. Any random large number will increase the security.  

## Create a new wallet
![new](../media/wizard_3-create.png)

Here you can create a new wallet file:

(1) **Wallet name:** Give a name for your wallet (in this example `testname` is used).  
(2) **Mnemonic seed: Write down your [mnemonic seed](https://getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/mnemonicseed.html) and keep it safe. Your seed is the master key of your wallet, you can use it to recover your funds.**  
(3) **Wallet location:** Select the destination folder of the wallet.  

### Add a password
![add password](../media/wizard_4-pass.png)

Add a strong password to protect your wallet. If you lose your password, then only your mnemonic seed can recover your wallet.

### Daemon settings
If your wallet is in advanced mode, the daemon settings page will open. Here you can choose if you are going to start a local node or connect to a remote node:

![daemon settings](../media/wizard_5-daemon-settings.png)

(1) **Start a node automatically in background (recommended):** Check this box to start a local node in the background and download the blockchain.  
(1.a) **Blockchain location (optional):** To store the blockchain somewhere other than default, enter that location here.  
(1.b) **Prune blockchain:** Check this box if you want to run your local node as a pruned node and download/sync a pruned blockchain from scratch (1/3 of the full blockchain). Leave this unchecked if you want to run your local node as a full node and download the whole blockchain (more than 110 GB).  
(1.c) **Bootstrap node:** Here you can enter the host/IP address and port of a bootstrap node (remote node). Your local node will temporarily connect to this third-party remote node while the blockchain is being downloaded, allowing you to use your wallet immediately. For a list of available remote nodes and info about them, check the [About remote nodes](#about-remote-nodes) section of this guide.  

![daemon settings_remote_node](../media/wizard_5-daemon-settings-remote-node.png)

(2) **Connect to a remote node:** select this option if you want your Monero GUI to connect to the Monero network using a remote node, and if you don't want to download the whole blockchain on the current computer. Remote nodes are servers running local nodes that have a full blockchain. These servers are usually run by third parties (which can be dangerous to your privacy), but you can also run your own remote node if you have technical knowledge. Check the ['About remote nodes' section](#about-remote-nodes) of this guide.  

If you don't have any remote node on your remote node list, you will have to add one. Click on **Add remote node**, and the following pop up will open:  

![settings_remote-node-edit](../media/black_settings-node-remote_node_edit.png)

To find a remote node, type 'Monero remote node' into your favorite search engine. Please ensure the node is run by a trusted third-party.  

(1) **Address:** Enter the hostname or IP address of the remote node.  
(2) **Port:** Enter the port of the remote node.  
(3) **Daemon Username:**  Enter a username in case authentication to the remote node is required.  
(4) **Daemon Password:**  Enter a password in case authentication to the remote node is required.  
(5) **Mark as Trusted Daemon:** By default, data requests to remote nodes are obfuscated, and this process requires more resources. If your remote node is under your control (i.e. a dedicated server of your own) you can mark it as trusted so that data requests will not be obfuscated anymore (just like a local node).

### Starting a local node
If you have selected to start a local node, every time you open your wallet you will see this pop up window:

![sync](../media/daemon-launch.png)

It has a countdown that allows you to change some settings before your wallet connects to the local node. If you don't want to change any setting, just let the countdown finish and your local node will be started automatically.  

## Create a new wallet from hardware
Monero GUI currently supports the hardware wallet models Ledger Nano S/X and Trezor Model T.

### How hardware wallets work with Monero GUI
+ The main function of your hardware wallet is to store your recovery seed in a device that never connects to the internet.
+ Your device has a single recovery seed, which is used to create Bitcoin and altcoins wallets, like Monero.
+ The recovery seed stored in your device will be used to generate two Monero private keys: a view key and a spend key.
+ Your private view key is exported from your hardware wallet device to the Monero GUI wallet.
+ Your private spend key never leaves your hardware wallet device. It is required to sign transactions.
+ How it works: 1) Monero GUI creates an unsigned transaction; 2) The unsigned transaction is sent to your hardware wallet device;  3) Your device asks if you want to confirm the transaction (sign the transaction with your private spend key); 4) After confirmed, the signed transaction is sent back to Monero GUI; 5) Monero GUI transmits the signed transaction to the Monero network

### Prepare your device
If you are using a Ledger Nano S/X, please make sure:

+ Your device is plugged in and unlocked
+ Your device has already been initialized before (your device already has a recovery seed)
+ Your device has the most recent firmware version (available in Manager section of Ledger Live desktop app) (see instructions for [Nano S](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002731113-Update-Ledger-Nano-S-firmware)/[Nano X](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013349800-Update-Ledger-Nano-X-firmware))
+ Your device has the Monero app installed (available in Ledger Live desktop app)
+ Your device is running the Monero app
+ Your computer has no other cryptocurrency wallet running in the background, like Ledger Live

If you are using a Trezor Model T, please make sure:

+ Your device is plugged in and unlocked
+ Your device has already been initialized before (your device already has a recovery seed)
+ Your device has the most recent firmware version (available in Trezor Wallet) ([see instructions](https://wiki.trezor.io/Firmware_update))
+ Your computer has no other cryptocurrency wallet running in the background, like Trezor Wallet, Trezor Suite, or Exodus Wallet

### Create a wallet from your hardware wallet device
![2.4.1](../media/create_hardware_wallet.png)

On this page you can create a new Monero wallet file from your hardware wallet device. This wallet file will be stored in your computer and, every time you open it, Monero GUI will ask you to connect and unlock your hardware wallet. If your device is using a passphrase, your passphrase will also be requested.  

(1) **Wallet name:** Give a name for your wallet file (in this example `ledger-test` is used).  
(2) **Wallet location:** Select the destination folder of the wallet file.   
(3) **Create a new wallet from device:** Select this option if this is the first time you use a hardware wallet.  
(4) **Restore a wallet from device:** Choose this option if you already had a hardware wallet and want to restore it.  
(5) **Device type:** Select the hardware wallet you want to use. Monero GUI currently supports the hardware wallet models Ledger Nano S/X and Trezor Model T. The older version of Trezor (Trezor One) is not supported.  

**Options when restoring a wallet from device:**  
(6) **Creation Date or Restore height (optional):** If you know the date or block height that your wallet was created at, you can specify it here so the wallet doesn't have to scan the entire blockchain looking for your funds. For example, if your first transaction was included on `2017-07-08` in block `1350000`, you should put the previous day date (e.g. `2017-07-06`) or a slightly lower height (e.g. `1330000`) so the wallet will start scanning from there, saving you some time. More information about restore height on [StackExchange](https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/7581/what-is-the-relevance-of-the-restore-height).  
(7) **Subaddress lookahead (optional):** Inform how many accounts and addresses you want Monero GUI to look up when restoring a wallet. The default value is 50:200, which means scanning 50 accounts with 200 subaddresses each, totalling 10.000 subaddresses to scan for initially. By specifying a smaller lookahead range, for instance 3:100, you decrease the computation required (your wallet will scan 300 subaddresses only), and can therefore restore your wallet faster. This comes at the risk of missing incoming funds if you have used more than 100 subaddresses or more than 3 accounts.   

### Ledger troubleshooting
+ Check if your device is plugged in and unlocked
+ Check if your device has already been initialized before (your device already has a recovery seed)
+ Check if your device has the most recent firmware version (available in Manager section of Ledger Live desktop app)
   + [Nano S Firmware](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002731113-Update-Ledger-Nano-S-firmware): latest version: 1.6.1 (release date: 11 August 2020)
   + [Nano X Firmware](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013349800-Update-Ledger-Nano-X-firmware): latest version: 1.2.4-5 (release date: 17 November 2020) 
+ Check if your device has the Monero app installed (available in Ledger Live desktop app)
+ Check if your device is running the Monero app
+ Close any cryptocurrency wallet running in the background, like Ledger Live
+ Restart your computer and try again
+ If you still can't connect to your Ledger, try using a different USB cable, changing the USB port, or connecting to a different computer. Avoid using USB hubs.
+ If your Monero GUI wallet is slow while using Ledger, make sure you're allowing your Ledger device to export the private view key to your computer. You should only export the private view key when using official Monero software.
+ Step by step guide for all operating systems (StackExchange): [How do I generate a Ledger Monero wallet with the GUI (monero-wallet-gui)?](https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/9901/how-do-i-generate-a-ledger-monero-wallet-with-the-gui-monero-wallet-gui)

### Trezor troubleshooting
+ Check if your device is plugged in and unlocked
+ Push the USB cable into your Trezor device until you hear/feel a click (this might require a little bit of force)
+ Check if your device has already been initialized before (your device already has a recovery seed)
+ Check if your device has the most recent firmware version (available in Trezor Wallet)
   + [Trezor Model T Firmware](https://wiki.trezor.io/Firmware_update): latest version: 2.3.6 (release date: 15 February 2021)
+ Close any cryptocurrency wallet running in the background, like Trezor Wallet, Trezor Suite, or Exodus Wallet
+ Restart your computer and try again
+ If you still can't connect to your Trezor, try using a different USB cable, changing the USB port, or connecting to a different computer. Avoid using USB hubs.
+ If you still can't connect, try installing [Trezor Bridge](https://wiki.trezor.io/Trezor_Bridge). It's usually not necessary to install Trezor Bridge, but some systems may require it to communicate with Trezor.
+ Step by step guide for all operating systems (StackExchange): [How do I generate a Trezor Monero wallet with the GUI (monero-wallet-gui)?](https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/11437/how-do-i-generate-a-trezor-monero-wallet-with-the-gui-monero-wallet-gui/)

### Add a password
![add password](../media/wizard_4-pass.png)

Add a strong password to protect your wallet file. If you forget the password of a wallet created from your hardware wallet, you will be able to create another wallet from your hardware device.

### Daemon settings (Advanced mode)
![daemon settings](../media/wizard_5-daemon-settings.png)

Here you can choose if you are going to run a local node or use a remote one:

(1) **Start node in background:** Check this box to run a local node and begin blockchain sync.  
(2) **Blockchain location (optional):** To store the blockchain somewhere other than default, enter that location here.  
(3) **Bootstrap node:** To use a bootstrap node enter the host and port. A bootstrap node allows you to use your wallet while you are downloading the blockchain by connecting to a remote node. For a list of available remote nodes and info about them, check the [About remote nodes](#about-remote-nodes) section of this guide.  
(4) **Connect to a remote node:** Check this box if you want to use only a remote node without downloading the blockchain. You will need to put the host and port of the remote node after checking the box.

### Starting a local node
If you have selected to start a local node, every time you open your wallet you will see this pop up window:

![sync](../media/daemon-launch.png)

It has a countdown that allows you to change some settings of the local node before it is started. If you click on "Use custom settings" button, the local node will not be started, and you will be redirected to the local node settings. If you don't want to change any setting of your local node, just let the countdown finish and it will be started automatically.  

### Receive and Send Monero with your hardware wallet
When using Monero GUI with a hardware wallet, every time you click on the send button, you will first have to confirm your transaction in your hardware wallet device, and then you will have to confirm it a second time in Monero GUI.

Sometimes you will also have to confirm in your device that you accept exporting the private view key (Ledger and Trezor) and key images (Trezor).

When using a hardware wallet, Monero GUI Receive page will display an additional "Show on device" button. By clicking this button, the address being displayed in Monero GUI should be displayed in your device. If both addresses match, you can be sure that the receiving address being displayed in Monero GUI was indeed created by your hardware wallet, and that it has not been changed by a virus infecting your computer.

## Open a wallet from file
This option will open a page displaying all wallet files contained in your wallets folder. If you want to open a wallet file with the extension `.keys` that is not contained in this folder, click on the "Browse filesystem" button.

## Restore wallet from keys or mnemonic seed

### Restoring from seed
![restore from seed](../media/wizard_6-restore-seed.png)

Restoring from your mnemonic seed is the easiest way to recover your wallet. You need to put the following information:

(1) **Wallet name:** Give a name for your wallet (in this example `testname` is used).  
(2) **Mnemonic seed:** Paste your seed made of 25 (or 24) words.  
(3) **Creation Date or Restore height (optional):** If you know the date or block height that your wallet was created at, you can specify it here so the wallet doesn't have to scan the entire blockchain looking for your funds. For example, if your first transaction was included on `2017-07-08` in block `1350000`, you should put the previous day date (e.g. `2017-07-06`) or a slightly lower height (e.g. `1330000`) so the wallet will start scanning from there, saving you some time. More information about restore height on [StackExchange](https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/7581/what-is-the-relevance-of-the-restore-height).  
(4) **Wallet location:** Select the destination folder of the wallet.  

A detailed guide is available on getmonero.org: ['How to restore your account'](https://getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/restore_account.html)

### Restoring from keys
![restore from key](../media/wizard_7-restore-keys.png)

Restoring from keys is quite easy and can be extremely useful, especially if you are moving your wallet from an online service like MyMonero. You need to put the following information:

(1) **Wallet name:** Give a name for your wallet (in this example `testname` is used).  
(2) **Account address:** The address of the wallet you are recovering.  
(3) **View key:** Your private view key (needed to be able to check your funds).  
(4) **Spend key:** Your private spend key (needed to spend your funds).  
(5) **Creation Date or Restore height (optional):** If you know the date or block height that your wallet was created at, you can specify it here so the wallet doesn't have to scan the entire blockchain looking for your funds. For example, if your first transaction was included on `2017-07-08` in block `1350000`, you should put the previous day date (e.g. `2017-07-06`) or a slightly lower height (e.g. `1330000`) so the wallet will start scanning from there, saving you some time. More information about restore height on [StackExchange](https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/7581/what-is-the-relevance-of-the-restore-height).  
(6) **Wallet location:** Select the destination folder of the wallet.  

When everything is ready click the right arrow and then the `Use Monero` button.  
A detailed guide is available on getmonero.org: ['Restoring wallet from keys'](https://getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/restore_from_keys.html)

## Change wallet mode
This button will open a page that lets you choose the mode that best suits your accessibility and privacy needs. Check "Choose wallet mode" section on Chapter 1 of this guide for more information about each mode.
