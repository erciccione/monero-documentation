# Running Monero GUI for the first time

Extract the package and click on `monero-wallet-gui`. The following window should open:

## Welcome
![Welcome](../media/wizard_0-welcome.png)

Welcome to Monero GUI Wallet.

(1) **Language symbol/English (US):** Click here to open a list of available languages. Select your desired language from the list.  
(2) **Continue:** Click here to continue to the next screen.  

If Monero GUI isn't displaying graphics correctly, you can try starting it in low graphics mode. If you're using Windows, please open `start-low-graphics-mode.bat` file located in your Monero GUI folder. You can find it in `C:\Program Files\Monero GUI Wallet` or you can find a shortcut for it in `Start Menu > Monero GUI Wallet > Utilities`. If you're using Linux, please try using the command `QMLSCENE_DEVICE=softwarecontext ./monero-wallet-gui`. Most macOS users shouldn't have graphic problems with Monero GUI, since it comes with OpenGL installed.

## Choose a Language
![Language](../media/wizard_1-lang.png)

Click on the language symbol or English (US) to display a list of available languages. Click on the one of your choice.
*Note:* You can always change the language later by clicking on the *globe* icon on the toolbar (upper-left corner).

## Choose wallet mode
![mode](../media/wizard_1_1-mode.png)

This page lets you choose the mode that best suits your accessibility and privacy needs.  
*Note:* connecting to Stagenet or Testnet requires *Advanced mode*.

(1) **Simple mode:** In this mode your wallet will display a simple interface with easy access to basic functionality like sending, receiving, transactions history, address book, accounts, and merchant mode, as well as hardware wallet support. It will **permanently connect to a third-party server** (a **remote node**), and it will not start a local node in your computer (the blockchain will not be downloaded). Choose this option if you don't have enough space to store the blockchain file, if you don't require maximum privacy and if you accept the privacy risks of using a remote node to connect to the Monero network.  
(2) **Simple mode (bootstrap):** In this mode your wallet will also display a simple interface with easy access to basic functionality. Additionaly it will start a **local node** that synchronizes a **pruned blockchain** in the background. This means your local node will start downloading only a part of the blockchain file, and your blockchain will be [pruned](https://www.getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/pruning.html) (1/3 of a full blockchain). This download can take several hours or even days to complete. While the pruned blockchain is being downloaded, your local node **will temporarily connect to a third-party server** (a **remote node** known as bootstrap node), which will allow you to start using Monero immediately. After downloading and synchronizing the pruned blockchain and the wallet, your local node will only temporarily connect to the bootstrap node when your blockchain is not updated. Be aware that using a remote node (including a bootstrap node) to connect to the Monero network may reduce your privacy.  
(3) **Advanced mode:** In this mode your wallet will display all advanced features available, like synchronizing a **local node** with the **full (non-pruned) blockchain** from scratch, changing fees/transaction priority, solo mining, message verification, transaction proof/check, offline transaction signing, key images importing, custom remote node (including .onion remote nodes), custom bootstrap node, starting a local node without setting a bootstrap node (maximum privacy), changing blockchain location, and daemon log. In this mode you can choose if you want to connect to the Monero network via a remote node or a local node. If you decide to run a local node, the full blockchain file (at least 110 GB) will be downloaded. If you want to start using Monero immediately, you can also set a bootstrap node (remote node) in the Settings > Node page. To achieve maximum privacy in your connection to the Monero network, it's recommended to avoid using a remote/bootstrap node and instead use advanced mode to start a local node without setting a bootstrap node.  

**Optional features:**  

(4) **Portable mode:** choose this mode if your Monero GUI executable is on a USB stick, an external disk drive or any other portable storage medium. When enabled, this mode will store your settings and create new wallets in the same folder of your Monero GUI executable, which means Monero GUI will not leave any traces (files) on the computer(s) you use to open your wallet files, and you will not have to reconfigure Monero GUI every time you open your wallet file in a different computer. But beware: selecting this mode will not move existing wallets into your Monero GUI executable folder, and it will not erase traces that may already have been left on your operating system  from previous installs (for instance, if you have previously used Windows installer to install Monero GUI in Program Files folder).  

## About the Simple mode/Simple mode (bootstrap)
![acknowledgement](../media/wizard_1_2-warning.png)

Upon choosing simple mode or simple mode (bootstrap), an acknowledgement page will be shown, explaining the features, behavior, and privacy constraints of using a remote mode.  

Please carefully read those informations before accepting the implications of this mode and proceed to the next step.  
You must understand the inherent risks of using a remote node for your privacy. If you connect to a *malicious* remote node, it could track your IP address, your "restore height" and associated block request data, and send you inaccurate information to learn more about transactions you make.

(1) **Acknowledgement:** Check this box if you have **fully understood** the privacy implications of a remote node and agree to **weaken your privacy** by using it.
