# Send Monero
![send](media/black_send.png)

The `Send` tab provides tools for creating outgoing transactions.

(1) **Amount:** This is how much Monero you want to send.  
(2) **Transaction priority:** This is the priority level your transaction will receive in the pool of transactions waiting to be confirmed. The more you pay, the higher your transactions priority for inclusion in a block.  
*Currently staying with the default or the slow option is likely to get you into the next block.*  
(3) **Address:** This is where you put the Monero address that you are sending to. Best practice is to copy and paste the address to prevent errors, accompanied with visually checking that the pasted address is correct.  
(4) **Description (optional):** Here you can add some information regarding your transaction for future reference. This function is for your record keeping only. The description text will be stored in your wallet file and only you will be able to see it. It will not be be sent to the receiver, nor stored on the blockchain.

**Advanced options** (requires wallet in advanced mode)

**View-only wallet:**  
(5) **Sweep unmixable:** This allows you to get rid of outputs in your wallet which have strange amounts like `0.000006839355` and can't be spent without combining them with another output.  
*Most users will never need to use this feature.*  
(6) **Create tx file:** This allows you to create a transaction file while using a view-only wallet. It is part of the offline transaction signing feature, which refers to the practice of keeping the private keys in an offline ("cold") device, that is only used to sign individual transactions. First, the transaction file is created in an online ("hot") device running a view-only wallet. Then this file is imported to an offline ("cold") device running a normal (spend) wallet, which signs the transaction file using the private keys. Finally, the signed transaction file is imported in the online device running a view-only wallet, which broadcasts the transaction to the Monero network.  
(7) **Submit tx file:** This allows you to import a transaction file that was previously signed in an offline ("cold") device running a normal spend wallet, broadcasting the transaction to the network.  
(8) **Import key images:** This allows you to import key images into your view-only wallet. When your view-only wallet has the key images for all outputs, it can display the true balance. In order to use this button, you must use a local node or be connected to a trusted remote node (you can set a trusted remote node in "Settings" > "Node" page).  

**Normal (spend) wallet:**  
(5) **Sweep unmixable:** This allows you to get rid of outputs in your wallet which have strange amounts like `0.000006839355` and can't be spent without combining them with another output.  
(6) **Sign tx file:** This allows you to sign a transaction file that was previously created on a view-only wallet. It is part of the offline transaction signing feature.  
(7) **Export key images:** This allows you to export your key images, which are needed to get the true balance of a view-only wallet.  

## Address Book
The `Address book` tab lets you save addresses that you frequently transact with. This is a convenient place to copy addresses from when creating transactions.
