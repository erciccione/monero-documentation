# Settings
The `Settings` tab provides tools for customizing configuration options.

### Wallet
![settings-wallet](media/black_settings-wallet.png)

(1) **Close this wallet:** Click here to safely close the current wallet and open the main menu.  
(2) **Create a view-only wallet:** Click here to generate a view-only (or audit) wallet file, which is capable to see all incoming transactions. In order to display the real balance, you must also import the key images from your normal wallet into your view-only wallet. The view-only wallet will be created with the same password as the current wallet. See this [user-guide](https://getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/view_only.html) for more information.  
(3) **Show seed & keys:** This button will redirect you to the [Seed and keys](#seed-and-keys) tab.  
(4) **Rescan wallet balance:** Click here to rescan all spent outputs from your wallet, updating your wallet balance. If your balance is still incorrect, you probably will have to resync your wallet after changing the wallet restore height to a restore height before the height of the first transaction to your wallet. To do this, go to the Settings > Info page, Wallet restore height, and click on the (Change) link.  
(5) **Change wallet password:** Click here to change the password of your wallet file.  
(6) **Enter merchant mode:** Click here to open Monero GUI's business-friendly mode.  


### Interface
![settings_interface](media/black_settings-interface.png)

The `Interface` tab is where you can adjust appearance and security settings of the GUI wallet. The options are:

(1) **Custom decorations:** Switch custom window decorations.  
(2) **Check for updates periodically:** Enable this option if you want your wallet to periodically check if a new version is available.
(3) **Hide balance:** Will display your balance as ?.?? in the balance card. It is a useful privacy feature if you are running your wallet in a public place, as a point of sales system, or if you have to take a screenshot or record your screen to someone.  
(4) **Light theme:** Switch between light and dark themes.  
(5) **Ask for password before sending a transaction:** Disable this option if you don't want to type your password every time a transaction is sent. This option is enabled by default.  
(6) **Autosave:** When enabled, your wallet file will be saved automatically, every 10 minutes (default) or at an interval of your choice. This option is enabled by default.  
(7) **Lock wallet on inactivity:** Set this to automatically lock your wallet after N minutes of inactivity. This ensures no one is able to use your wallet while you are away from keyboard.  
(8) **Enable displaying balance in other currencies:** Gives you the possibility to also display your balance, the transaction amount and transaction fee in other currencies. You can select the price source and the currency you prefer (currently only *USD* and *EUR* are supported).

### Local Node
![settings_local-node](media/black_settings-node-local_node.png)

(1) **Start/Stop Local Node:** Depending on its current state, either start or stop the local node.  
(2) **Blockchain location:** Manually enter a non-default path to the blockchain, or click `change` to choose a new path.  
(3) **Startup flags:** When using a local node, this will be where you enter additional command line options.  
(4) **Bootstrap Address:** Enter the hostname or IP address of the bootstrap remote node. See section [Bootstrap nodes](#bootstrap-nodes) for a brief explanation of what a bootstrap node is.  
(5) **Bootstrap Port:** Enter the port of the bootstrap remote node.  

### Remote Node
Use a remote node, do not download the blockchain. Check the ['About remote nodes' section](#about-remote-nodes) of this guide.

![settings_remote-node](media/black_settings-node-remote_node.png)

(1) **Address:** Enter the hostname or IP address of the remote node.  
(2) **Port:** Enter the port of the remote node.  
(3) **Daemon Username:**  Enter a username in case authentication to the remote node is required.  
(4) **Daemon Password:**  Enter a password in case authentication to the remote node is required.  
(5) **Trusted Daemon:** By default, data requests to remote nodes are obfuscated, and this process requires more resources. If your remote node is under your control (i.e. a dedicated server of your own) you can mark it trusted so that data requests will not be obfuscated anymore (just like a local node).

### Log
![settings-log](media/black_settings-log.png)

(1) **Log level:** Change the verbosity of the debug logs.  
(2) **Log categories:** Add specific categories to the debug logs.  
(3) **Daemon log:** Real time output of the log.  
(4) **Command line:** Interact with the daemon.

### Info
![settings-info](media/black_settings-info.png)

(1) **GUI Version:** Version of the GUI wallet installed.  
(2) **Embedded Monero Version:** Version of the embedded daemon in use.  
(3) **Wallet path:** Where the wallet is located on your computer.  
(4) **Wallet restore height:** Your wallet synchronization starts at the block defined in wallet restore height. Therefore, you must set the restore height before the height of the first incoming transaction of your wallet. If you click on the (Change) link, you can set a blockheight or a date. After changing it, your wallet will rescan the blockchain starting from the blockheight you set. *Note: when you change your wallet's restore height, you will lose all information that is stored in the wallet software and cannot be recovered from the blockchain, which includes destination addresses, transaction keys, and descriptions (notes).*   
(5) **Wallet log path:** Where the logs for this wallet will be saved.  
(6) **Wallet mode:** Display the wallet mode chosen in the [wizard](#choose-wallet-mode).  
(7) **Graphics mode:** Display the graphics mode.  
(8) **Copy to clipboard:** Copy all information to clipboard.  

## Seed and keys
![seed-keys](media/black_seed-keys.png)

The `Seeds & Keys` tab displays your wallets mnemonic seed as well as your secret view key, public view key, secret spend key, and public spend key.

(1) **Mnemonic seed: DO NOT share your mnemonic seed with anyone. Store a copy securely.** The mnemonic seed is a 25 word phrase that contains all the information needed to view and spend funds. *Learn more about [mnemonic seeds](https://getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/mnemonicseed.html).*  
(2) **Wallet restore height.** This is the blockheight of the first incoming transaction of your wallet. This information is useful when you restore your wallet, because you will only have to synchronize the blockchain for the period that is needed.  
(3) **Primary address:** This is the main address of your wallet and starts with 4. All other addresses from your wallet are subaddresses, and start with 8.  
(4) **Secret view key:** Secret (private) view keys allows the holder to view your wallets incoming transactions, but not outgoing. It is sometimes useful for auditing purposes to give your secret view key to a third party.  
(5) **Public view key:** The public view key is used for stealth address creation. *Learn more about [view keys](https://getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/viewkey.html).*  
(6) **Secret spend key: DO NOT share your secret spend key with anyone. The secret (private) spend key is used to sign transactions and should be regarded with the same security as your mnemonic seed.**  
(7) **Public spend key:** The public spend key is used by the network to verify the signature of the key image you generate when you make a transaction. This is what prevents double-spends as the network enforces the rule that a key image can be spent only once. *Learn more about [spend keys](https://getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/spendkey.html).*

![seed-keys](media/black_seed-keys_2.png)

(6) **Export Spendable Wallet: DO NOT share your spendable wallet QR code with anyone. This can be used like a mnemonic seed for recovering your wallet.** This creates a qrcode that contains all of your keys.  
(7) **Export View Only Wallet:** This creates a QR code that contains only the keys for viewing the transactions that this wallet sends or receives, but cannot create transactions.
