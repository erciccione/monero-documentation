# Settings
The `Settings` tab provides tools for customizing configuration options.

### Wallet
![settings-wallet](media/black_settings-wallet.png)

(1) **Close this wallet:** Click here to safely close the current wallet and open the main menu.  
(2) **Create a view-only wallet:** Click here to generate a view-only (or audit) wallet file, which is capable to see existing outgoing transactions and all incoming transactions. See this [user-guide](https://getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/view_only.html) for more information.  
(3) **Show seed & keys:** This button will redirect you to the [Seed and keys](#seed-and-keys) tab.  
(4) **Rescan wallet balance:** Click here to rescan the blockchain for all the transactions. *Note: You will lose all information that is stored in the wallet software and cannot be recovered from the blockchain, which includes destination addresses, transaction keys, and descriptions.*  
(5) **Change wallet password:** Click here to change the password of your wallet file.

### Interface
![settings_interface](media/black_settings-interface.png)

The `Interface` tab is where you can adjust the settings of the GUI wallet. The options are:

(1) **Custom decorations:** Switch custom window decorations.  
(2) **Hide balance:** Will display your balance as ?.?? It is a useful feature if you are running your wallet in a public place, as a point of sales system.  
(3) **Light theme:** Switch between light and dark themes.  
(4) **Lock wallet on inactivity:** Set this to automatically lock your wallet after N minutes of inactivity. This ensures no one is able to use your wallet while you are away from keyboard.  
(5) **Enable displaying balance in other currencies:** Gives you the possibility to display your balance also in other currencies. You can select the price source and the currency you prefer (*USD* or *EUR*).

### Local Node
![settings_local-node](media/black_settings-node-local_node.png)

(1) **Start/Stop Local Node:** Depending on its current state, either start or stop the local node.  
(2) **Blockchain location:** Manually enter a non-default path to the blockchain, or click `change` to choose a new path.  
(3) **Startup flags:** When using a local node, this will be where you enter additional command line options.  
(4) **Bootstrap Address:** Enter the hostname or IP address of the bootstrap remote node. See section [Bootstrap nodes](#bootstrap-nodes) for a brief explanation of what a bootstrap node is.  
(5) **Bootstrap Port:** Enter the port of the bootstrap remote node.  


### Remote Node
Use a remote node, do not download the blockchain. Check the ['About remote nodes' section](#about-remote-nodes) of this guide.

![settings_remote-node](media/black_settings-node-remote_node.png)

(1) **Address:** Enter the hostname or IP address of the remote node.  
(2) **Port:** Enter the port of the remote node.  
(3) **Daemon Username:**  Enter a username in case authentication to the remote node is required.  
(4) **Daemon Password:**  Enter a password in case authentication to the remote node is required.  
(5) **Trusted Daemon:** By default, data requests to remote nodes are obfuscated, and this process requires more resources. If your remote node is under your control (i.e. a dedicated server of your own) you can mark it trusted so that data requests will not be obfuscated anymore (just like a local node).

### Log
![settings-log](media/black_settings-log.png)

(1) **Log level:** Change the verbosity of the debug logs.  
(2) **Log categories:** Add specific categories to the debug logs.  
(3) **Daemon log:** Real time output of the log.  
(4) **Command line:** Interact with the daemon.

### Info
![settings-info](media/black_settings-info.png)

(1) **GUI Version:** Version of the GUI wallet installed.  
(2) **Embedded Monero Version:** Version of the embedded daemon in use.  
(3) **Wallet path:** Where the wallet is located on your computer.  
(4) **Wallet restore height:** Change the block height that a wallet rescan will go back to.  
(5) **Wallet log path:** Where the logs for this wallet will be saved.  
(6) **Wallet mode:** Display the wallet mode chosen in the [wizard](#choose-wallet-mode).  
(7) **Graphics mode:** Display the graphics mode.  
(8) **Copy to clipboard:** Copy all information to clipboard.  

## Seed and keys
![seed-keys](media/black_seed-keys.png)

The `Seeds & Keys` tab displays your wallets mnemonic seed as well as your secret view key, public view key, secret spend key, and public spend key.

(1) **Mnemonic seed: DO NOT share your mnemonic seed with anyone. Store a copy securely.** The mnemonic seed is a 25 word phrase that contains all the information needed to view and spend funds. *Learn more about [mnemonic seeds](https://getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/mnemonicseed.html).*  
(2) **Secret view key:** Secret view keys allows the holder to view your wallets incoming transactions, but not outgoing. It is sometimes useful for auditing purposes to give your secret view key to a third party.  
(3) **Public view key:** The public view key is used for stealth address creation. *Learn more about [view keys](https://getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/viewkey.html).*  
(4) **Secret spend key: DO NOT share your secret spend key with anyone. The secret spend key is used to sign transactions and should be regarded with the same security as your mnemonic seed.**  
(5) **Public spend key:** The public spend key is used by the network to verify the signature of the key image you generate when you make a transaction. This is what prevents double-spends as the network enforces the rule that a key image can be spent only once. *Learn more about [spend keys](https://getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/spendkey.html).*

(6) **Export Spendable Wallet: DO NOT share your spendable wallet QR code with anyone. This can be used like a mnemonic seed for recovering your wallet.** This creates a qrcode that contains all of your keys.  
(7) **Export View Only Wallet:** This creates a QR code that contains only the keys for viewing the transactions that this wallet sends or receives, but cannot create transactions.
